**THIS PROJECT IS NO LONGER ACTIVELY MAINTAINED**

FLemit is a library that allows dynamic ABC (ActionScript Byte Code) code to be generated and executed at runtime. FLemit is NOT an ActionScript compiler; it requires users have a thorough knowledge of the AVM2.

FLemit currently only exists as the basis for [FLoxy](https://github.com/richardszalay/floxy), the dynamic proxy generation library which, in turn, was created for ASMock. For that reason, it's APIs are not currently documented and will change dramatically in the future.
